<p>Plain and simple - I love design.</p>

<p>I focus on user experience, simplicity and accessibility. I have been using Adobe Photoshop since version 5 and coding my own designs since the one pixel spacer gif era.</p>

<p>I have almost 13 years experience in WordPress development, UI design and branding.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about creating custom, responsive WordPress themes from scratch.</p>

## WordPress Development Workflow

I develop locally. When it comes to creating an offline WordPress environments I tend to use Local by @<a href="https://github.com/getflywheel">Flywheel</a>. It is one of the most intuitive and powerful tools for the job and allows me to spin fast WordPress installations in containers. Local offers root SSH access, WP-CLI, Database managment, mailcatcher, NGINX and the ability to hot-swap PHP versions. So you can tinker around if your heart desires!
